//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
About: To ensure that the program works as expected, the following circumstances must be met. Each SQLite instruction should end with a semi-colon, except the .EXIT command. The SQLite program must contain a .EXIT to tell the program to stop running. Otherwise, the program will infinite loop until terminated manually. The spacing also matters. Although the program accounts for most spacing differences from the provided SQLite file, the SQLite file tested should still follow the spacing convention displayed in the provided SQLite test file. 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
How to Run and Compile 
The user must first navigate to where the program is stored on the computer through terminal. The SQLite test file should also be located in the same directory as the makefile and program files. A makefile is provided to compile this program so all the user has to do is type:

	make
	./main < (test file name)

The program should now run and execute based on the commands stored in the file that is being fed in.
